<strong>Title:</strong> ECCT: Ensemble Consensual Collaborative Training for Facial Expression Recognition with Noisy Annotations Resnet models  

<strong> Our proposed ECCT framework<strong>
  
![Proposed framework](images/ECCT_framework.png)

ECCT involves training ensemble of three networks $\theta_1, \theta_2 \text{ and } \theta_3$ jointly using a convex combination of supervision loss and consistency loss. Consensus is built by aligning the posterior distributions (shown as dotted red curves between $p_{1},p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ ) using consistency loss. Dynamic weighing factor($\lambda$) that balances both the losses is described in section \ref{DB}.
