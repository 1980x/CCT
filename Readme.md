<strong>Title:</strong> ECCT: Ensemble Consensual Collaborative Training for Facial Expression Recognition with Noisy Annotations Resnet models  

<strong> Our proposed ECCT framework<strong>
  
![Proposed framework](images/ECCT_framework.png)

 ECCT involves training ensemble of three networks θ1; θ2 and θ3 jointly using a convex combination of supervision loss and consistency loss. Consensus is built by
aligning the posterior distributions (shown as dotted red curves between p1; p2 and p3 ) using consistency loss. Dynamic weighing factor(λ) that balances both the losses is given by Gaussian like ramp-up function.


Annotated FEC Dataset will be released after the publication.
